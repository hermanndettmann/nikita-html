# Components

Because [nikita.kickstarter](https://github.com/nikita-kit/nikita-kickstarter) uses [Assemble](http://assemble.io/) as static site generator, these files use the handlebars file extension `.hbs`. So you can copy the files directly into your partials-folder. If you do so, you have to define additionally the data-json and/or handlebars expressions.
